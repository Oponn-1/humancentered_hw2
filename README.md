Human Centered Data Science, Assignment 2

The goal of this project is to peform some exploratory analysis on data from wikipedia comments which have been labeled by people as either being toxic, aggressive, personal attacks, or none of the above. This data has been used to train machine learning models, so it is important to examine potential sources of bias in the data. 

To this end, I focus on the question of whether male and female annotators have different words which they frequently find either toxic or aggressive. Any disparity would indicate situational bias in the data which could be troublesome for an ML model.

All analysis and further explanation are in the jupyter notebook.
